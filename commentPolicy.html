        <p>Welcome to my blog. We try our best to make sure that the discussions on our articles are the troll, spam and abuse free but we’re not omnipresent. The comment section can be a great place for interaction with readers, writers and even for spawning stimulating conversation – it can be a great place for all of us! To ensure that you have a good time over here at my blog, please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:</p>
        <p>Be polite – don’t be rude to anyone and respect others. If something you would say would get you bottled on the head offline, please don’t say it here. Remember there is a person behind the screen and that your words affect people. Don’t troll. We appreciate and welcome criticism towards writers here, but comments that add no value to the discussion or that are merely insulting would be deleted without exception.</p>
        <p>Spam? Goodbye. We understand that you may make thousands of dollars working from home, however, we are not interested. Please refrain from posting or we’ll give you a hand and show both you and your post the door.</p>
        <p>To put it in a simple sentence, our guidelines boil down to “Don’t be a dick”. If you don’t follow any of these guidelines, not only will our moderators remove the comment but we may also ban you from participating in the discussions.</p>
        <p>If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’ – our moderators highly appreciate your support!</p>
        <p>Happy commenting!</p>
